## 1. Project Description
A web application where users compete in prompt engineering competitions. Competitions are created by researchers, companies, or other users to solve specific LLM-related problems.

## 2. Purpose
Finding the best prompt for LLM tasks is often time-consuming, involving trial and error. This web app gamifies the process, allowing users to participate in competitions, speeding up prompt discovery through collective effort.

## 3. How It Works
- **Create Competitions**: Users create tasks with specific metrics.
- **Compete**: Participants submit prompts to solve the task.
- **Rank and Optimize**: Submissions are ranked based on performance, helping users find the most effective prompts.

## 4. Why It Matters
This platform saves time by crowdsourcing prompt optimization, encourages collaboration, and adds a competitive element to make prompt engineering more engaging.
