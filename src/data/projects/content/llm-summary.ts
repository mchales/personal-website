In 2023, many large language models (LLMs) had limited context windows, which made it difficult to directly summarize lengthy texts, such as books. While this issue has been largely addressed in more recent models, it still persists in some smaller ones. This project aims to develop smart summarization techniques using LLMs to efficiently summarize large documents.
